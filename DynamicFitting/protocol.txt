########Run setup

For help with syntax/usage:
Simply run the script without any arguments,
script_path is the path to top level scripts folder
eg. bash script_path/calculation/make_cafeinput_monomer.sh

#### Protocol for Running CafeMol
First of all, make a project directory and cd to this directory
If you are running for the first time, you have to generate the CG model, so proceed to step 1.
If you already have the CG model of pdb and the ninfo file, proceed to step 2.


1. All atom runs to create CG model and native info file

	•       Warning: Please refine you structure in all atom using Xplor-NIH, before CG conversion
	•	For monomer, copy the script_path/templates/monomer_ini folder to your project directory and cd to monomer_ini
	•       For dimmer, copy the script_path/templates/dimer_ini folder to your project directory and cd to dimer_ini
	•	Specify the necessary file path at the top of the input file
	•	No AFM data needed for this step
	•	The PDB file (all atom) works as is. No further processing needed
	•	Only keep the last model from the output PDB file, which will be the input CG pdb file for afm run.
	•	In case of dimer, introduce a TER word between two chain in the PDB for chain termination (cafemol is fussy about this).
	•       Run Cafemol:  path/cafemol.exe input.inp

2. AFM fitting run
	•       Prepare the input AFM file based on afm surface (file with x, y and z coordinates cropped from the experimental AFM image using any desire package, for example: MountainsSPIP or Gwyddion). 
	•	For monomer, Run: bash script_path/calculation/make_cafeinput_monomer.sh afm_file cg_pdb_file ninfo_file
	•	For dimer, Run: bash script_path/calculation/make_cafeinput_dimer.sh afm_file cg_pdb_file ninfo_file

Inputs:
	afm_file -  is the afm data file in nanometer units
        cg_pdb_file -  is the CG model of PDB obtained from all atom to cg calculation
        ninfo_file - is native info file from all atom to cg conversion calculation, edit ninfo_file if needed (see Step 3)

	•	Edit the input CafeMol file "input_cafe.inp" for md_steps, total atoms (look for GROUP(1)) and accordingly kappa, x/y pixel size and pixel numbers n_x, n_y.
           	 If you want to run in simulated annealing mode, change i_run_mode to 3 and edit the section "annealing".
           	 Please note: You do not have to set up any path or rename any PDB or ninfo file. This is set up by the script.
	•	After the calculation is complete, check the output folder.


Step 3. Edit the ninfo file to scale the force coefficients and add tertiary contacts (works for both monomer and dimer)

	•	To only scale the force coefficients:
		Run: python script_path/calculation/edit_ninfo_full.py scale_factor ninfo_file

	•	To scale coefficients and add tertiary restraints
		Run: python script_path/calculation/edit_ninfo_full.py scale_factor ninfo_file restraint_file cg_pdbfile

            	The scale_factor is given as [x,x,x,x,x,x,x] representing [bond, angle, dihedral_1,dihedral_2,long_range, basepair, basestack]   "x" represents the multiplication factor, eg.[2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
            	Templates for restraint file is given in the path: script_path/calculation/restraints_monomer.txt

	•	To separately scale the coefficients for duplex and non duplex regions
		Run: python script_path/calculation/scale_coef_duplex_ninfo.py scale_duplex scale_nonduplex ninfo_file basepair_file cg_pdbfile

            	Both scale_duplex, and scale_nonduplex have the form [x,x,x,x,x,x,x] representing [bond, angle, dihedral_1, dihedral_2, long_range, basepair, basestack] and "x" represents the multiplication factor.
            If all of the residues participating in bond, angle, long range, basepair and base stack 
            belong to duplex, the duplex scaling factor is chosen. For dihedral, if both second and 
            third residue belong to the duplex, the duplex scaling factor is applied.

	•	To remove tertiary contacts between a group of residues and rest of the molecule
		Run: python script_path/calculation/remove_contacts_ninfo.py  "A:1-20,B:30-40" ninfo_file cg_pdbfile

            In above example we choose chain A with residues 1 thr 20, and chain B with residues 30 thr 40, the script will remove all long range restraints between each of these groups and rest of the molecule.


A) Running multiple kappa runs and analysis to get the best kappa combinations

1.	Setting up runs for multiple kappa values

	•	Generate copies of a template folder to run cafemol runs at various kappa values

	•	Copy the file setupNsubmit.sh to your top directory containing the template folder.
   
  	 Usage:
            	bash script_path/calculation/setupNsubmit.sh template_directory kappa.txt

    	Inputs:
    		template_directory    template folder that has a complete set up for the cafemol run
   		kappa.txt             file with column of kappa values

    		example of kappa.txt is given at script_path/calculation/
   		please remove any empty lines at the end of file in kappa.txt

   
B)  Running multiple runs with varying X,Y pixel scaling and Z scaling to find the best scaling parameters
    
1.	Setting up runs for multiple X,Y pixel scaling, Z scaling and kappa scaling.
         Generate copies of a template folder to run cafemol runs at various XY and Z scale factors
         and kappa values and submit all the runs

   Usage: 
      bash script_path/calculation/scan3D.sh '[x1,x2,dx] [z1,z2,dz] [k1,k2,dk] c templt_folder'

   Inputs:
      x1,x2,dx              x1,x2 lower and upper bound for scale factor for x and y direction, dx is the increment interval. Both x and y pixel coordinates are scaled by the same amount
      z1,z2,dz              z1, z2 are lower and upper bound for scale factor for z direction, dz is the increment interval
      k1,k2,dk              k1, k2 are lower and upper bound for kappa values, dk is the kappa increment interval
      c                          cutoff value for z, z values are first scaled and any scaled value of z below cutoff is set to 0
      templt_folder       template folder that has a complete set up for the cafemol run

      This script also generates a file called scan3Dlist.txt that contain all combinations of xy and z scale factors and kappa values
