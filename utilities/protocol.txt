##Helper scripts

1.	Write pdb model from dcd file 

	. Create a folder and add all dcd files inside named as respectively the kappa value used for that trajectory. For example: k2.dcd for trajectory with kappa=2.
   Usage:
         python Writepdb_Alltraj.py  

Inputs: 
	path_traj      the full path to the file with all the trajectory information (Full_Trajectory.cs) 
	dcd_traj       the full path to the folder with dcd files 
	ref            the full path and name of the CG topology model. (This file could be your initial model used to run dynamic fitting)


2.	Coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement
	(i)	First is required to create an optimum all atom covalent geometry file, this can be obtained using: 

		pyXplor genIni.py 

	Inputs: 
		genIni.py received a pdb all atom model file named as rna_ini-allatom.pdb

	(ii)	Carry out the CG to all atom conversion and xplor refinement

   	Usage:
        	 bash script_path/cg2aa/ submit_toAllAtom.sh cgRNA_list_file

   	Inputs:
         	Path_       		   change scriptFile to the full path of toAllAtom.py into submit_toAllAtom.sh (line 10)
		rna_ini-allatom_good.pdb   good covalent geometry all atom structure  the full path and file name need to be specified into submit_toAllAtom.sh (line 20)
		model_file.bpl      	   base pair list file, example at script_path/cg2aa/ model_file.bp. The full path and file name need to be specified into submit_toAllAtom.sh (line 22)
		cgRNA_list_file   	   file containging full path of a list of cg PDBs, example at script_path/cg2aa / pdb_list.txt
        CG to all atom conversion and Xplor refinement is iterated for each PDB.

3.	Convert all atom model to Cafemol format 
   Usage:
         bash script_path/cg2aa/ format_pdb_xplor.sh path_to_pdb_folder 
Inputs:
      path_to_pdb_folder      path to the folder with desire all atom pdb to be convert to Cafemol reading format 

4.	Calculate the base pair and base stack number for pdb models 

	Usage:
         	python bases_calc.py
	Inputs:
		path1           add path to the folder where all .pdb files are located  and correct  format to be read by cafemol (line 14) 
		cafe            add path to the folder bases_calc (line 15)      
		cafemol.exe 	add path to cafemol.exe (line 35)


5.	Create a smooth data set to base pair and base stack values from a sample to the full trajectory 
	Usage:
         	python smooth.py
	Inputs:
		path1        add path to the folder where all .pdb files are located  and correct  format to be read by cafemol (line 14) 
		cafe         add path to the folder bases_calc (line 15)      



6.	Fix covalent geometry and minimize the RNA structur, regularizes bond, angle and improper terms, not allowing significant motion of the P atoms.

   Usage:
           xplor script_path/Helper_scripts/regularize.py FILE.pdb > regularize.out
           where you specify PDB file as FILE.pdb. The regularized structure is written to 
           FILE.pdb.out
