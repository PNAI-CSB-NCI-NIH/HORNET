## Helper scripts for writing pdb models from dcd files, coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement, base pair and base stack calculation

## Three folders are available: writing pdb models from dcd files (outpdb), coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement (cg2aa), and  base pair and base stack calculation (bases_calc)



1. For writing pdb models from dcd files is required to install python/3.7 and MDTraj dependency (instruction for installation at https://www.mdtraj.org/1.9.8.dev0/index.html)


2. For coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement is required to have installed Xplor-NIH/3.4 (instruction for installation at https://nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih/)


3. For  base pair and base stack calculation is is required to have installed Cafemol/3.2, python/3.7 and pandas. 

Warning - All requirements and input are following the previous step output named file, e.g, Cg to all atom script is written to received CG pin files output from step 1. 


4. The usage of each script is explained in the protocol.txt file
