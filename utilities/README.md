Helper scripts for writing pdb models from dcd files, coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement, base pair and base stack calculation

Three folders are available: writing pdb models from dcd files (outpdb), coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement (cg2aa), and base pair and base stack calculation (bases_calc)


1. For writing pdb models from dcd files is required to install python/3.9 and MDTraj dependency (instruction for installation [here](https://www.mdtraj.org/1.9.8.dev0/index.html)). The user can download a dcd file example to test the functionality [here](https://home.ccr.cancer.gov/csb/pnai/data/HorNet/tutorial/k30.dcd).


2. For coarse-grained (CG) model to all atom conversion and refinement is required to have installed Xplor-NIH/3.4 (instruction for installation [here](https://nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih/))


3. For  base pair and base stack calculation is is required to have installed Cafemol/3.2, python/3.9 and pandas. 

Warning - All requirements and input are following the previous step output named file, e.g, Cg to all atom script is written to received CG pin files output from step 1. 


4. The usage of each script is explained into respectively folder.
